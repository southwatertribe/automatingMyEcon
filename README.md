# automatingMyEcon
I noticed a way I can automate my econ assignment, this was a formative assignment and I did my work as needed, I simply made this to test my skills and see if my idea worked. (It did)
I saw that all the answers where to be a float value in the form of X.XX. The script opens the webpage, signs in with my student ID and fills in the answer box starting from 0.00 and tests if correct. 
If not, it increments by 0.01 and loops until it finds the right answer, super fast. The answers have to be copied and pasted onto a word document so I programmed my computer to beep when the correct answer was found and stop.
This allowed me to do other work while the script ran and stop me with a beep to check the answer myself. Pretty funny but it worked.
